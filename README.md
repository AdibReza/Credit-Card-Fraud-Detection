# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project was very interesting. There were Almost 3 lakhs data but amoung them only 492 were fraudulent transaction data. So I couldn't use this highly imbalanced dataset. In order to feed these data to my dumb ML model, I had to make a seperate dataset by taking 492 rows from each of the sections, legit and fraudulent.  
I used Logistic Regression as this was a binary classification. Had fun doing this project. Hope you do too.  

Happy learning ya'll :)
